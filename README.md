# `gtsam-stubs`

PEP 561 style type annotations for GTSAM.

Note this package may have bugs (wrong annotations), and some return types should not be `Any` but annotated with the actual return types.

If you encounter such types, please help by replacing them with the actual type (like `Union[Isotropic, Unit]`), and make a PR to this repo.
